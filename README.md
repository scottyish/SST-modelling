# SST-modelling
R scripts for SST modelling using DMC.

The stop signal task (SST) model setup and description can be found in the accompanying paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811923001349).

The Bayesian Hierarchical model is implemented using the Dynamic Models of Choice (DMC) package in R.
